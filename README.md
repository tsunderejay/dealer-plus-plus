# dealer++
a schedule 1 multiplayer expansion mod. what more what less?

all users need the same config password. tbh you can probably remove this functionality, i literally just removed the stupid bits from the current multiplayer mod.
this is also compatible with the current multiplayer mod. 

# features
- more than 4 players
- config for password and lobby size (not tested for more than 20 players)

# basic config
"dealer++" = { LobbySize = 20, LobbyPassword = "yo" }
